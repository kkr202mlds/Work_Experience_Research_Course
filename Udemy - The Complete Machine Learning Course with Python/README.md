# Feature Selection
- Every model has several parameters or features depending upon the number of layers, number of neurons, etc. The model can detect many redundant features or features determinable from other features leading to unnecessary complexity. We very well know that the more complex the model, the higher the chances of the model to overfit.
- Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.
