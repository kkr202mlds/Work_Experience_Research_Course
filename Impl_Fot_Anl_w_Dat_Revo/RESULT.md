# CONCLUSION

- This thesis provides a research template with Pass Classification and Sequence, I state that K-Means Clustering Models and Sequential Neural Network Model trained suitable for evaluating Pass Count,
- Likely Passes, we found less evidence in favour of their Passes Predictability by Team Ball Movement. The Result of  Passes Predictability is 0.11 to 0.55%.
- The Logistic Regression Model and K-Means Cluster Model information for passes location are known.
- In this model, % of Overall Passes completed is 74.3% and % of Accuracy of Correct predictions of logistic regression is 76.16%.
- The AUC of the logistic regression model is 75.2% and AUC of the final piecewise model is 83.1% and ROC Curve is far from perfect ROC.
