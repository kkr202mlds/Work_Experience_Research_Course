## ABSTRACT
- Football is the most popular sport in the world, watched by kids, teenagers and
adults. As Football becomes more popular by the minute, teams are constantly
looking for new creative ways to improve their performance and compete on a
higher level.
- This internship aims to determine the Pass Count, Likely Passes, Predictability and
Estimate the Pass Difficulty in Football Matches. To achieve our goal, we would
start by defining the research thesis, extracting requirements and studying the
subject.
- In this internship, I will take you on how to analyze Football Matches Data using
Python. In this case, I will analyze the 2018/2019 FA Women's Super League
match.
- To analyze, there is the use of Machine Learning models like K-Means Clusters,
Logistic Regression and Sequential Neural Networks. Finally, we create the
application using Python language and implement a machine learning model.
- This internship investigates the Predictability and Hardness of Passes of Machine
Learning models for Football Data. To achieve this objective, I train a Machine
Learning model on football data. In the end, I found the result of Pass
Predictability between 0.0011 to 0.0055, % of Overall Passes is 74.3%, the Model
Accuracy of Correct predictions result is 76.16%, the AUC Curve of Logistic
Regression K-Means Model is 0.831and AUC Curve of Piecewise Model is
0.752.
### Keywords: Football Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.
